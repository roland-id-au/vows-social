# Latest Updates - 2025-10-07

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database & Storage Cleared
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **What**: Cleared all pipeline data (preserving cache and schema)
- **Tables cleared**:
  - `discovered_listings`
  - `enrichment_queue`
  - `listings`
  - `listing_media`
  - `packages`
  - `listing_tags`
  - `api_cost_transactions`
  - `notification_queue`
  - `discovery_queue`

**Cache Preserved**: ‚úÖ Perplexity in-memory cache retained (cost savings)

**Storage Note**: Storage bucket (listing-images) needs manual clearing via Supabase Dashboard if needed:
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nidbhgqeyhrudtnizaya/storage/buckets/listing-images
- Delete files/folders as needed

### 2. Smart Slug Generation with Perplexity
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Deployed
- **Feature**: Perplexity now generates 3-5 SEO-friendly slug suggestions
- **How it works**:
  1. Perplexity provides multiple slug options in priority order
  2. System tries each suggestion until finding an available slug
  3. Falls back to auto-generation if all suggestions are taken
  4. Logs which slug was selected and why

**Example Suggestions**:
```json
{
  "slug_suggestions": [
    "gunners-barracks-mosman-nsw",
    "gunners-barracks-wedding-venue-mosman",
    "gunners-barracks-sydney-harbour",
    "gunners-barracks-mosman-sydney",
    "historic-gunners-barracks-mosman"
  ]
}
```

**Selection Logic**:
```
1. Try "gunners-barracks-mosman-nsw" ‚Üí Available? ‚úÖ Use it
2. If taken, try "gunners-barracks-wedding-venue-mosman"
3. If taken, try "gunners-barracks-sydney-harbour"
4. Continue through all suggestions...
5. If all taken, generate: "gunners-barracks-mosman-nsw-2"
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Avoids duplicate slug errors
- ‚úÖ Better SEO (Perplexity understands context)
- ‚úÖ More descriptive URLs
- ‚úÖ No more manual slug conflict resolution
- ‚úÖ Automatic fallback if needed

### 3. Schema Updates
**Perplexity Schema** (`enrichment-processor/index.ts:173-179`):
```typescript
slug_suggestions: {
  type: 'array',
  description: '3-5 SEO-friendly URL slug suggestions...',
  items: { type: 'string' },
  minItems: 3,
  maxItems: 5
}
```

**Required Fields**: Added `slug_suggestions` to required fields

### 4. Edge Function Deployment
- **enrichment-processor**: ‚úÖ Deployed with slug suggestions
- **Version**: Latest (includes all Phase 1 features)

## üîÑ How Slug Selection Works

### Before (Manual Check + Suffix)
```typescript
// Old approach
slug = "gunners-barracks-mosman-nsw"
if (exists) slug = "gunners-barracks-mosman-nsw-1"
if (exists) slug = "gunners-barracks-mosman-nsw-2"
// Not SEO-friendly, repetitive
```

### After (AI-Powered Suggestions)
```typescript
// New approach
suggestions = [
  "gunners-barracks-mosman-nsw",
  "gunners-barracks-wedding-venue-mosman",
  "gunners-barracks-sydney-harbour",
  "historic-gunners-barracks-mosman",
  "gunners-barracks-mosman"
]

for (suggestion in suggestions) {
  if (!exists(suggestion)) {
    slug = suggestion
    break // Found unique, SEO-friendly slug
  }
}
```

**Result**: More meaningful URLs, better SEO, fewer conflicts

---

## üìä Testing

### Test Slug Generation
Run enrichment and check logs:
```bash
# Watch enrichment processor logs
curl -X POST https://nidbhgqeyhrudtnizaya.supabase.co/functions/v1/enrichment-processor \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [KEY]"

# Check logs for:
# "Trying 5 Perplexity slug suggestions..."
# "‚úÖ Selected slug: 'gunners-barracks-mosman-nsw' (Perplexity suggestion)"
```

### Verify Database
```sql
-- Check slug variety
SELECT slug, title FROM listings ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Should see descriptive slugs like:
-- gunners-barracks-mosman-nsw
-- gunners-barracks-wedding-venue-mosman
-- NOT just: gunners-barracks-mosman-nsw-1, -2, -3
```

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Add DNS record** for images.vows.social (see DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md)
2. **Test pipeline** with fresh data:
   ```bash
   # Run discovery
   curl -X POST https://nidbhgqeyhrudtnizaya.supabase.co/functions/v1/discovery-processor

   # Run enrichment
   curl -X POST https://nidbhgqeyhrudtnizaya.supabase.co/functions/v1/enrichment-processor
   ```
3. **Verify**:
   - Images use CDN URLs
   - Slugs are unique and descriptive
   - Metadata auto-generates
   - Quality filtering works

### Phase 2 (Next Feature)
- Instagram feed enrichment
- Automated Discord cost reports
- Production monitoring
