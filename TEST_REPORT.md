## Critical Issues

### 🔴 Issue #1: Discovery Returns 0 Vendors

**Severity**: High
**Impact**: Pipeline cannot discover new vendors

**Symptoms**:
- All completed discovery tasks show `discoveries_found: 0`
- Tested with `"wedding venue in Wollongong, Australia"` - found 0 vendors
- No existing vendors in Wollongong, so not a duplicate issue

**Possible Causes**:
1. Perplexity API not responding (check logs)
2. Perplexity API response format changed
3. JSON parsing failing silently
4. Query format incorrect
5. Cache returning empty results

**Diagnostic Steps**:
```bash
# Check Edge Function logs
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nidbhgqeyhrudtnizaya/logs/edge-functions

# Look for:
- Perplexity API call logs
- Response parsing logs
- "Found X vendors" logs
```

**Suspected Code Location**:
`supabase/functions/discovery-processor/index.ts:76-136`

### 🔴 Issue #2: Enrichment Tasks Not Created

**Severity**: High
**Impact**: Discovered vendors not being enriched

**Symptoms**:
- 9 discovered listings with `enrichment_status: 'pending'`
- 0 rows in `enrichment_queue` with `status: 'pending'`
- Gap in the pipeline flow

**Expected Behavior**:
When discovery processor saves to `discovered_listings`, it should:
1. Insert into `discovered_listings`
2. Insert into `enrichment_queue` with the `discovery_id`

**Suspected Code Location**:
`supabase/functions/discovery-processor/index.ts:179-192`

**Possible Causes**:
1. Enrichment queue insert failing silently
2. Transaction rolling back
3. Code path not being executed

---

## Recommendations

### 1. **Immediate: Check Perplexity API Logs** (Priority: HIGH)

Navigate to:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nidbhgqeyhrudtnizaya/logs/edge-functions

Filter for `discovery-processor` and look for:
- Perplexity API calls
- Response data
- Parsing errors

### 2. **Add Debug Logging to Discovery Processor** (Priority: HIGH)

Add console.log statements to track:
```typescript
console.log('Calling Perplexity API...', {
  query: task.query,
  location: task.location
})

console.log('Perplexity response:', data)
console.log('Parsed discoveries:', discoveries)
```

Redeploy and test:
```bash
supabase functions deploy discovery-processor
curl -X POST "https://nidbhgqeyhrudtnizaya.supabase.co/functions/v1/discovery-processor" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_KEY"
```

### 3. **Fix Enrichment Task Creation** (Priority: HIGH)

Check if enrichment tasks are being created. Add error handling:
```typescript
// Create enrichment task
const { data: enrichmentTask, error: enrichmentError } = await supabase
  .from('enrichment_queue')
  .insert({
    discovery_id: discovery.id,
    vendor_name: vendor.name,
    // ...
  })
  .select()
  .single()

if (enrichmentError) {
  console.error(`Failed to create enrichment task: ${enrichmentError.message}`)
  await discord.error('Enrichment task creation failed', enrichmentError)
}
```

### 4. **Backfill Missing Enrichment Tasks** (Priority: MEDIUM)

For the 9 pending discovered listings, manually create enrichment tasks:

```sql
-- Create enrichment tasks for pending discoveries
INSERT INTO enrichment_queue (
  discovery_id,
  vendor_name,
  location,
  city,
  country,
  service_type,
  priority,
  scheduled_for
)
SELECT
  id as discovery_id,
  name as vendor_name,
  location,
  city,
  country,
  type as service_type,
  5 as priority,
  NOW() as scheduled_for
FROM discovered_listings
WHERE enrichment_status = 'pending'
AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM enrichment_queue WHERE discovery_id = discovered_listings.id
);
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today)

1. ✅ **Check Edge Function logs** for discovery processor
   - Look for Perplexity API responses
   - Check for parsing errors

2. 🔧 **Add debug logging** to discovery processor
   - Log Perplexity request
   - Log Perplexity response
   - Log parsed vendors
   - Log save operations

3. 🔧 **Test Perplexity API directly**
   ```bash
   # Test if API key works
   curl -X POST 'https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions' \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"model":"sonar-pro","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"List 5 wedding venues in Sydney"}]}'
   ```

4. 🔧 **Fix enrichment task creation**
   - Verify enrichment queue inserts
   - Add error handling
   - Redeploy discovery processor

### Short-term (This Week)

1. 📊 **Backfill missing enrichment tasks** (SQL script above)

2. 🔍 **Investigate "processing" discovered listings**
   - Why are 6 listings stuck in processing?
   - Add timeout/cleanup mechanism

3. 📈 **Add monitoring**
   - Set up scheduled task to run discovery every hour
   - Set up scheduled task to run enrichment every 30 minutes
   - Set up scheduled task to run publishing every 15 minutes

### Long-term (Next Sprint)

1. 🎯 **Instagram integration** (currently blocked by Deno/Python issue)
   - Deploy external Python service
   - OR rewrite in TypeScript/Deno

2. 📊 **Dashboard**
   - Build admin dashboard to monitor pipeline
   - Show queue statuses
   - Manual retry buttons

3. 🔔 **Better error notifications**
   - Discord alerts for failures
   - Daily digest reports

## Conclusion

The pipeline infrastructure is **solid and functional**:
- ✅ All functions deployed
- ✅ All secrets configured
- ✅ Database schema correct
- ✅ Enrichment and publishing working well (7/7 success rate)

**Critical blockers**:
1. Discovery processor not finding vendors (needs log investigation)
2. Enrichment tasks not being created for discovered vendors

Once these two issues are resolved, the pipeline should operate fully automatically.

**Estimated time to fix**: 1-2 hours
**Estimated impact**: High - will unblock the entire discovery pipeline
