---

## 3. Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing Locality/Region Columns

**Problem:** Discovery function was trying to insert `locality` and `region` fields that don't exist in database

**Fix:** Removed locality/region from:
- Interface definition
- Structured schema
- Database insert mapping

### Issue 2: Generic Event Spaces

**Problem:** Discovery was returning corporate event spaces, not wedding-specific venues

**Fix:** Updated Perplexity prompts to:
- Filter for REAL WEDDINGS only
- Exclude corporate events and styled shoots
- Prioritize couple content
- Verify wedding suitability

### Issue 3: Old Content

**Problem:** No emphasis on recency in discovery

**Fix:** Updated prompts to:
- Prioritize last 7-14 days
- Emphasize "MOST RECENT"
- Filter for posts from last 30 days
- Order by recency

---

## 4. Data Quality

### âœ… Structured Output Working

Both functions use Perplexity's structured output (json_schema) correctly:
- Deep research returns comprehensive venue data
- Discovery returns array of trending venues
- All fields properly typed and validated

### âœ… Wedding Focus Working

Discovery function now returns:
- Real wedding posts (not styled shoots)
- Couple content emphasis
- Wedding-specific trending reasons
- Recent timeframes mentioned

### âœ… Geographic Tagging Working

All venues tagged with:
- Country: Australia
